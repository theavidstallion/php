This directory is for rock-paper-scissor game I made in php. It is a basic project mainly for learning purposes at beginning phases,
and doesnot involve complex or advanced php and other web technologies.
Concepts Used:
Model-View-Controller, Request-Response Cycle (HTTP Methods - GET, POST, REQUEST), Hashing function (used for security), Functions,
Arrays, Control Expressions and Flow, HTML Forms, Loops, Basic CSS styles, and some preset Php functions like random_int() etc.
Feel free to modify as much as it would need to suit your wishes.
Files:
index.php  -  Main/Starter webpage with links to login and game. The game.php link here is for purpose of demo only.
login.php  -  The web app asks for credentials, for now, only password needs to be correct as it is in server, username can be anything.
game.php  -  After successful login, the web app takes user to the game page where he can play the game, apart from three selection
             options of rock, paper, and scissor, you can also input the option "Test", that will display all possible inputs and outputs
             that will ensure the credibility of game.
bootstrap.php  -  A file dedicated to bootstrap linking bootstrap to the styles.css file.
styles.css  -  File dedicated to style the webpages, it has used both CSS and Bootstrap.
